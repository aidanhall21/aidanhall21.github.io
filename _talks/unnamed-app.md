[Unnamed App](https://melodic-clafoutis-891e96.netlify.app/)

This is an as yet unnamed app that I'm developing. I run my own simulations using projections to attack MLB pickem lines on Underdog and elsewhere. I decided to slap a frontend on those sims and give it out to the public for free. I'm still working out the kinks in the production version so the app is still in beta but should be fully operational in time for the 2025 MLB season. I also plan on creating some neat tools/visuals that will make tracking and following your MLB Best Ball teams much easier and more fun.
