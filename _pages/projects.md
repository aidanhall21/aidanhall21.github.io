A list of various other projects I've worked on and contributed to in more or less reverse chronological order.

*************

### Underdog Fantasy Pickem Scraper ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/underdog-fantasy-pickem-scraper))

This is an easy to use Python script that scrapes the available pickem lines from Underdog Fantasy Sports and outputs the results to a CSV file.

### Getting Unique: Exploring the Impact of Rare Player Combinations in Best Ball Mania ([GitHub](https://github.com/fantasydatapros/best-ball-data-bowl/blob/master/submissions/Exploring%20the%20Impact%20of%20Rare%20Player%20Combinations%20in%20Best%20Ball%20Mania.ipynb))

My submission to the 2023 Best Ball Data Bowl. I was one of five finalists selected to [appear on stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs-chTKQkIE) and discuss my submission.

### Run The Sims Little Data Bowl Submission ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/RTS-Little-Data-Bowl))

My submission that won the [2022 Little Data Bowl](https://www.runthesims.com/littledatabowl/) organized by Justin Freeman of [runthesims.com](https://www.runthesims.com/). We developed novel methods to predict the number of duplicate lineups for any given NFL DFS showdown lineup. The code in the repo was eventually refined, productionalized, and provided to Run The Sims.

*************

### Daily Fantasy Baseball Projection System ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/daily-fantasy-baseball-projection-system))

During PitcherList.com's expansion into daily fantasy content around 2021, I was part of a team tasked with developing a proprietary projection system. The project became more extensive than anticipated, and I eventually took on most of the development work. Although I left PitcherList before the product fully launched, I'm proud of the work I contributed.

*************

### Fantasy Baseball Auction Calculator ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/fantasy-baseball-auction-calculator))

*Available at PitcherList.com*  
Another tool I built while working with PitcherList to assist with fantasy baseball auctions.

*************

### NFluence ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/NFluence))

During the 2020 crypto boom, a friend and I initiated an NFT minting and marketplace platform. I successfully shipped a prototype product, but ultimately, the company didn't gain the traction needed to move forward.

*************

### Fractional Topshot ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/fractional-topshot))

Amid the NFT surge, I wanted to learn Cadence and developed code to allow for the fractionalization of NBA Topshot moments.

*************

### World Ultimate Ratings ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/wur))

I taught myself web scraping and database design by extracting all college and club ultimate frisbee results from the USA Ultimate website. The goal was to apply the Bradley-Terry model to rate teams and simulate future tournament outcomes. Although it was previously hosted at worldultimateratings.com and didn't gain significant traffic, it was a fun project that I might revive if there's enough interest from amateur ultimate frisbee enthusiasts.

*************

### Am I Good At Predicting The Future? ([Medium](https://medium.com/@aidanbhall/am-i-good-at-predicting-the-future-at-least-when-it-comes-to-stock-trades-37aa26a7a0e6))

My initial venture into data analysis with Python, exploring the efficacy of predicting stock trades.

*************

### Premier League App ([GitHub](https://github.com/aidanhall21/premier-league-app?tab=readme-ov-file))

My first foray into JavaScript and web development, this app suggests which Premier League team you should support based on various factors.
