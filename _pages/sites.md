This is a list of websites and apps that I've made that are currently live on the internet.

### Underdog MLB Pickem Sims App ([link](https://melodic-clafoutis-891e96.netlify.app/))

This is an as yet unnamed app that I'm developing. I run my own simulations using projections to attack MLB pickem lines on Underdog and elsewhere. I decided to slap a frontend on those sims and give it out to the public for free. I'm still working out the kinks in the production version so the app is still in beta but should be fully operational in time for the 2025 MLB season. I also plan on creating some neat tools/visuals that will make tracking and following your MLB Best Ball teams much easier and more fun.

### Dinger Data ([link](https://dinger-data.streamlit.app/))

A site that I built that myself and others used to track the season long and week to week fantasy scoring output for MLB players during the 2024 MLB Best Ball season. I built this because it was otherwise impossible to find Underdog specific scoring results in an easily searchable format. I do plan on tracking scoring fo the 2025 season either at this same site or incorporating it into a larger app that I have plans for.

### Pickem Results Tracker ([link](https://aidanhall21.evidence.app/))

A site I built that tracks my Underdog Fantasy Pickem performance. Needs to be updated to reflect the end of the 2024 MLB season.
